Totals
------
- Core delivery subtotal: **BDT 5,163,000**
- Recommended contingency reserve (8%): **BDT 413,000**
- **Grand total budget: BDT 5,576,000**

Notes
-----
- Rates reflect Dhaka market for senior contractors; adjust for in-house salaries if different.
- External service fees (Twilio sender IDs, Stripe onboarding, device lab access) are not included and should be budgeted separately.
- Accelerating delivery would require additional developer/designer capacity, increasing the hourly burn accordingly.
