Milestone Highlights
--------------------
- **M1 (Week 6)**: Foundation ready â€” design system, environment, project scaffold.  
- **M2 (Week 12)**: Core user flows (onboarding, request creation) functional in QA.  
- **M3 (Week 18)**: Matching, chat, notifications integrated end-to-end.  
- **M4 (Week 22)**: Payments, disputes, and impact features complete.  
- **M5 (Week 25)**: Launch readiness with QA sign-off and release collateral.

Notes
-----
- Stakeholder reviews scheduled at the end of each milestone week to approve progression.  
- Buffer for holidays/emergencies: 1-2 spare weeks recommended post-M5 if launch date flexible.  
- Additional specialists (design, backend, compliance) may be slotted ad-hoc without altering developer allocation.  
- Timesheet can convert to invoice template by adding hourly rate and approval signature sections.
